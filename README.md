# KnowHow's React Challenge App â€“ By Alejandro Salazar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilized [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/).

## Available Scripts

Once you have pulled or downloaded the repository locally, in order to run the code, you can use:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Alternatively, you can run the same script but with `yarn`, which in my humble opinion is a much better package manager
